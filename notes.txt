- blocks: object that holds information might have to be moved to a table in a database. a block table per corridor.
- blocks is consisted by:
{
		short: "D.3.1.Truck Travel Time Index",
                content: "On average, trucks travelling along the corridor experienced up to a double travel time.\n"+
                "The Travel Time Index Ranged between 1.3 (Section 7) and 2.3 (Section 2)",
                sources: "National Performance Management Research Data Set (NPMRDS)",
                periods: "February 2017 - July 2017",
                note: "Data was not available for Section 1 (between Piedras St. and Paisano Dr.)",
                description: null,
                overall: false,
                name: "D.3.1. Truck Travel Time",
                chart_name: "Truck Travel Time Index",
                chart_format: "tti",
                chart_display: true,
                mode: ["F"],
                key: "tttia", //this could be replaced by an easier key: corridor and property e.g. montana_d31
                super_short: "D.3.1."
};
- the blocks will be manipulated by an admin page that has access/read/write permissions to the blocks table in the db.
- how to deal with corridors? -- I might have giant chunks of code in a case statement that deal with the program behaviour depending on the currently selected corridor.
- google maps might be a problem. think of other tools to switch to them.
